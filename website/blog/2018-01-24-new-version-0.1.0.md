## Preface

About five months works, we finally get a first drop for `react-bootstrap-table2`. I just want to say that I'm very sorry to let you guys to wait for a long time.   

I know a lots of people experienced many bugs or feel hard to customize on table. Anyway, I'm very appreciated everyone's helps and feedbacks, I think that's the reason why I decided to rebuilt `react-bootstrap-table2`.
